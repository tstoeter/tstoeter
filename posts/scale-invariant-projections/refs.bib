abstract = {Abstract Many visualization techniques involve mapping high-dimensional data spaces to lower-dimensional views. Unfortunately, mapping a high-dimensional data space into a scatterplot involves a loss of information; or, even worse, it can give a misleading picture of valuable structure in higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose class consistency as a measure of the quality of the mapping. Class consistency enforces the constraint that classes of n–D data are shown clearly in 2–D scatterplots. We propose two quantitative measures of class consistency, one based on the distance to the class's center of gravity, and another based on the entropies of the spatial distributions of classes. We performed an experiment where users choose good views, and show that class consistency has good precision and recall. We also evaluate both consistency measures over a range of data sets and show that these measures are efficient and robust.},

abstract = {Abstract Visual quality measures seek to algorithmically imitate human judgments of patterns such as class separability, correlation, or outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework for evaluating such measures. The basic idea is to take a large set of visually encoded data, such as scatterplots, with reliable human “ground truth” judgements, and to use this human-labeled data to learn how well a measure would predict human judgements on previously unseen data. Measures can then be evaluated based on predictive performance—an approach that is crucial for generalizing across datasets but has gained little attention so far. To illustrate our framework, we use it to evaluate 15 state-of-the-art class separation measures, using human ground truth data from 828 class separation judgments on color-coded 2D scatterplots.},

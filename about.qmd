Hello and welcome to my blog!
Here, I share my reflections and discoveries as I embark on an exciting journey in visual computing.
Iâ€™m currently a research associate in the [Visual Computing](https://vc.cs.ovgu.de/) group within the [Department of Simulation and Graphics](https://www.isg.ovgu.de/en) at [Otto von Guericke University](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) Magdeburg.
Previously, I worked as a research software engineer at the [Combinatorial NeuroImage Core Facility](https://www.lin-magdeburg.org/cni) of the [Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology](https://www.lin-magdeburg.org) and served as the executive co-lead for a task area in the [NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/home/) national research data initiative.
